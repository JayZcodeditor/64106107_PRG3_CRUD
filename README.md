## How to Run ðŸš€

**Before Deploying:**
Before deploying the application, remember to save your changes by pressing <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Ctrl + S</span> in the <span style="color: blue;">pubspec.yaml</span> file.

**Update IP Address:**
In the <span style="color: blue;">Config.dart</span> file, locate and update the <span style="color: blue;">Ipserver_connect</span> variable to match your server's IP address.

## Initialize JSON Server:
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to start the JSON server using your <span style="color: blue;">data.json</span> file:
```
json-server -H <ip address > data.json <Port>
```

**Update Server Variable:
In the <span style="color: blue;">config.dart</span> file, adjust the <span style="color: blue;">server</span> variable to match your server's URL.

## Run the App:**
Open the <span style="color: blue;">main.dart</span> file in your Flutter project. Make sure you're not debugging and just want to run the app. Run the app to see your changes in action!

By following these steps, you'll be able to easily set up and run your Flutter application with the necessary configurations. Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸ“±ðŸŽ‰
