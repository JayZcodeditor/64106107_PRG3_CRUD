## How to Run ðŸš€
**Before Deploying:**

Before deploying the application, remember to save your changes by pressing Ctrl + S in the pubspec.yaml file.

**Update IP Address:**

In the Config.dart file, locate and update the Ipserver_connect variable to match your server's IP address.

**Initialize JSON Server:**

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to start the JSON server using your data.json file:
/////json-server -H data.json

**Update Server Variable:**

In the config.dart file, adjust the server variable to match your server's URL.

**Run the App:**

Open the main.dart file in your Flutter project. Make sure you're not debugging and just want to run the app. Run the app to see your changes in action!

By following these steps, you'll be able to easily set up and run your Flutter application with the necessary configurations. Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸ“±ðŸŽ‰
